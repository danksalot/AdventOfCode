# AdventOfCode
[Advent of Code](www.adventofcode.com) is a site that I found in December of 2015.  It was setup by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) and was an advent calendar with a new puzzle each day leading up to Christmas.  Most of the puzzles required coding to solve, but there were some that I was able to solve using a text editor and some clever regex find-and-replace statements.  

I have added the puzzles from 2015 here, and will be adding my solutions to them as soon as I can locate where I put them.

I can't wait to see if Eric has new puzzles for us in 2016!
